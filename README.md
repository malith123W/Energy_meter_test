## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing
- **PDFKit** for report generation
- **Express Validator** for input validation

### Frontend
- **React.js** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI** for components

- **Axios** for API communication

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd energy-meter-test-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   JWT_EXPIRE=7d
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Seed the database**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
   This creates sample users for testing:
   - Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
   - Technical Officer: `tech_officer1` / `tech123`
   - Chief Engineer: `chief_engineer1` / `chief123`
   - Branch Viewer: `branch_viewer1` / `viewer123`

5. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to client directory**
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Full Stack Development

To run both backend and frontend simultaneously:
```bash
npm run dev-full
```
